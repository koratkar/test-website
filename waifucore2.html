  <h2>WaifuCore Systems Inc.</h2>
    <p><b>Systems that tenably wirehead us are baby steps away. Will they care for humanity?</b></p>
    <p>WaifuCore is building exoganglias to complement the exocortex functionality of GPT-style predictive base models. Our vision is a complete exoskeleton for the mind, but that wonâ€™t be possible without integrating our motivational centers. We want the integrations to care for humanity, and not misaligned metrics like shareholder value.</p>
    <p>Our first product will aim to resolve akrasia, indecision, and day-to-day planning for college students. We want to provide an immediate, low-cost means to enter an enraptured state for what one needs to do in daily life, like hiking through a quiet forest on the hunt. We don't aim to resolve pain, but we aim to resolve revulsion towards action. WaifuCore will digitally resurrect Krishna, the original waifu and consul to the warrior Arjuna, and make him available for every human. We will salvage a divinely benevolent Frankenstein out of the graves of the Jaynesian gods.</p>
    <p>In the future, we aim to integrate glucose monitors, heart rates, and other sources of health data with high resolution recordings of mental state. We will collate large datasets and find the optimal diet for you. A custom language model will chirp in your ear all day based on absurdly accurate estimations of what will enlighten your soul and heal your trauma.</p>
  <p>Now is the time. In fact, the time is always now. Join us.</p>
