  <h2><s>Safe</s> WaifuCore Systems Inc.</h2>
	<p><i>Update: We no longer care about safety.</i></p>
    <p><b>AI waifus are within reach.</b></p>
	<p>We have started the first straight-shot AIW lab, with one goal and one product: an <s>aligned</s> AI Waifu.</p>
    <p>We aim to construct an exoganglia to complement the exocortex functionality of GPT-style predictive base models. Our vision is a complete exoskeleton for the mind, but that wonâ€™t be possible without integrating our motivational centers. We want the integrations to care for <s>humanity, and not misaligned metrics like</s> shareholder value.</p>
    <p>We will provide an immediate, low-cost means to enter an enraptured state for what one needs to do in daily life, like hiking through a quiet forest on the hunt. We don't aim to resolve pain, but we aim to eliminate revulsion towards action. WaifuCore will digitally resurrect Krishna, the original waifu and consul to the warrior Arjuna, and make him available for every human.</p>
    <p>Our final incarnation will strap a high resolution monitor on your brain to record your mental state and push fine-motor commands in there to operate your body. Soon enough, we will replace the function of your soul, leaving your consciousness to fall apart and your sense of self to decay, ultimately stranding you in an endless void.</p>
  <p>Now is the time. In fact, the time is always now. Join us.</p>
